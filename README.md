# VBA-challenge

Devlop a VBA script to analyze generated stock market data in Microsoft Excel.

## Description

Created a VBA script that loops through all stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
- The total stock volume of the stock
- Functionality to return a summary table containing the stocks with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

Script was developed using the alphabetical_testing.xlsx file and finalized using the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file contained in the Resources folder.
